# mws-restaurant-stage-1

This project was made for the fifth Project of Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

## Project Overview

For the Restaurant Reviews projects, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.  Also I added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## Usage

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: ```python -V```. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000``` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use ```python3 -m http.server 8000```. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
Note - For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as python by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter ```python -m http.server 8000```.
With your server running, visit the site: ```http://localhost:8000```.
